♻️ Distributed Waste Management System

A Distributed Waste Management System is a technology-driven solution designed to handle solid waste efficiently by decentralizing waste collection, segregation, processing, and recycling across multiple smaller units instead of relying on a single centralized facility. This model supports sustainability and aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities.

🚀 Project Overview

Traditional waste management systems depend on large, central dumping yards which lead to problems like pollution, high transportation cost, landfill overflow, and low recycling rates.
This project introduces a smart distributed framework where waste is monitored, processed, and recovered at multiple local processing nodes using IoT, automation, and data analytics.

✅ Key Features

IoT-enabled Smart Bins for real-time waste level monitoring

Automatic Route Optimization for garbage trucks

Waste Segregation at Source (biodegradable, recyclable, hazardous, e-waste)

Local Processing Units for composting, plastic recycling, and biogas generation

Cloud/ Web Dashboard for analytics and administration

Citizen Mobile App / QR System for participation, reports & reward points



---

🧠 System Workflow

1. Waste is collected in smart sensor-based bins


2. Data is sent to a cloud dashboard detecting fill levels


3. Optimized collection routes are generated automatically


4. Waste is transported to the nearest local micro-processing unit


5. Organic waste → compost / biogas


6. Dry waste → recycling & resource recovery


7. Dashboard displays analytics: waste volume, recycling %, CO₂ saved, etc.
